# Book-Search-Engine

## Description
    
The application is a search engine for books. I have built a graphQL server to allow the user to test their API routing in a simple and clean UI which autopopulates a lot of the required inputs. This allows significantly less technical users to interact with the development, testing and feedback of the application's capabilities
